<h3>Sibling Spill-overs and Education Choice</h3>
<p>Considering its immense, life changing consequences, our choice of which university education to pursue often seems ill-informed. I estimate how siblings influence and inspire each others in their choices, using a unique Swedish data set. I also estimate economic returns to fields of study and research how education affects financial decision making.</p>

<section id="predicting-replication" class="level3">
<h3>Predicting Replication</h3>
<p>We use machine learning to estimate a model that is more accurate than a prediction market at forecasting replication success of lab experiments. We also study which features drive this accuracy. The model could be used as a cheap and efficient tool to aid researchers in evaluating the necessity of running replications ex ante.</p>

<section id="homophily-and-information-avoidance" class="level3">
<h3>Homophily and Information Avoidance</h3>
<p>There is a vast literature in Psychology and Economics about how we tend to learn selectively, searching for ways to confirm our priors and biases. Using both empirical and experimental data, I study how this type of motivated reasoning affects who we choose to follow and be friends with.</p>
