<h3>Sibling Spill-overs and Education Choice</h3>
<p>Considering its immense, life changing consequences, our choice of university education often seems ill-informed. I estimate how siblings influence and inspire each others in their choices, using a unique Swedish data set where identification comes from tie breaking lotteries. I also use this data set to study economic returns to fields of study and how education influences investment and savings decisions. To avoid data-mining pitfalls, the study was <a href="https://osf.io/rj6t7/">pre-registered</a>.</p>

<section id="predicting-replication" class="level3">
<h3>Predicting Replication</h3>
<p>I use machine learning to estimate a model that is more accurate than a prediction market at forecasting replication success of lab experiments. While statistical properties of the original paper such as its p-value explain most of the variation, certain elements of the expirements’ design are also influential. The model could be used as a cheap and efficient tool to aid researchers in evaluating the necessity of running replications ex ante.</p>

<section id="social-sciences-replication-project" class="level3">
<h3>Social Sciences Replication Project</h3>
<p>We replicate 21 experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science in 2010-2015. As in our previous studies, we also run prediction markets to elicit peer beliefs.</p>

<section id="homophily-and-information-avoidance" class="level3">
<h3>Homophily and Information Avoidance</h3>
<p>There is a vast literature in Psychology and Economics about how we learn selectively, searching for ways to confirm our priors and biases. Using economic theory and an experiment, I aim to study how this type of motivated reasoning affects network formation; who we choose to follow and be friends with.</p>
