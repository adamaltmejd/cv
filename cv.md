## Current projects

### Sibling Spill-overs and Education Choice
Considering its immense, life changing consequences, our choice of which university education to pursue often seems ill-informed. I estimate how siblings influence and inspire each others in their choices, using a unique Swedish data set. I also estimate economic returns to fields of study and research how education affects financial decision making.

### Predicting Replication
We use machine learning to estimate a model that is more accurate than a prediction market at forecasting replication success of lab experiments. We also study which features drive this accuracy. The model could be used as a cheap and efficient tool to aid researchers in evaluating the necessity of running replications ex ante.

### Homophily and Information Avoidance
There is a vast literature in Psychology and Economics about how we tend to learn selectively, searching for ways to confirm our priors and biases. Using both empirical and experimental data, I study how this type of motivated reasoning affects who we choose to follow and be friends with.
