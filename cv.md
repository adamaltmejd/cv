## RESEARCH

### Prediction Markets for Science
    Research collaboration with, among others, Magnus Johannesson and Anna Dreber Almenberg (http://www.citationfuture.com).
    In a various number of projects, we study how prediction markets can be used to ameliorate the scientific process. Eliciting private information, prediction markets allow us to study replicability and quality of research. Currently working on a market on replication of studies in behavioral economics.

### Money as a store of value - Bringing Hugget to the lab
    Experimental macroeconomics project with Siri Isaksson. In the context of the Hugget (1993) economy, we study how and why fiat money can be valued as an equilibrium selection process. We run laboratory experiments based on said model and study how risk preferences affect the degree of money valuation.

### Strategic Unawareness
    Using models of unforeseen contingencies due to Kreps (1979) as well as Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini (2001), I study how deci- sion makers interact in a non-cooperative setting. I explore the notion and existence of equilibria in such games where players have subjective state spaces and are not necessarily aware of the consequences of their actions.
