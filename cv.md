## Research

### Choosing Money
Valuation of fiat money is universal today. Choosing to hold intrinsically worthless cash is a convention that can be understood as one among many equilibria of some coordination game. Recent macroeconomic frameworks aimed at modelling this behavior do generate monetary economies, but are unable to provide any criteria for equilibrium selection. Hence, while agents can choose money, it is ambiguous if they will.

We seek to provide an explanation to the universality of money by experimentally evaluating how and why fiat money can be valued as an equilibrium selection process. We do this by implementing a version of the Hugget (1993) economy, proposed by Krusell, Mukoyama and Smith (2011) in the lab, and treat subjects in key dimensions. Joint with [Siri Isaksson](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=31631033).

### Prediction Markets for Science
In several different projects, we study how prediction markets can be used to ameliorate the scientific process. By eliciting private information, prediction markets allow us to study beliefs in replicability and quality of research. Currently working on a market on replicability in behavioral economics. Joint with, [Magnus Johannesson](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=1981033) and [Anna Dreber Almenberg](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=12741033) among others (a complete list of contributors is available [online](http://www.sciencepredictionmarkets.com)).

### Evolution of preferences for ambiguity
Joint with [Thomas Seiler](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?personid=34461033), we explore evolutionary stability of ambiguity-contingent preferences in different settings.

### Games with *unknown unknowns*
Inspired by Grant and Quiggin (2013) as well as Karni and Vierø (2014) I study the effect of knowledge of one's own unawareness of possible states in strategic environments.
