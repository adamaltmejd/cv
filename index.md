## Current projects

### Predicting Replication
In a follow-up to Camerer et. al. (2016), I use machine learning techniques to build a model that is better than a market at predicting replication success. I also study which features are most important.

### Choosing Money
Valuation of fiat money is universal today. Choosing to hold intrinsically worthless cash is a convention that can be understood as one among many equilibria of some coordination game. Recent macroeconomic frameworks aimed at modeling this behavior do generate monetary economies, but are unable to provide any criteria for equilibrium selection. Hence, while agents can choose money, it is ambiguous if they will.

We seek to provide an explanation to the universality of money by experimentally evaluating how and why fiat money can be valued as an equilibrium selection process. We do this by implementing a version of the Hugget (1993) economy, proposed by Krusell, Mukoyama and Smith (2011) in the lab, and study how financial restrictions motivate agents to use money. Joint with [Siri Isaksson](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=31631033).

### Evolution of preferences for ambiguity
Recently, theories of games with Knightian uncertainty, or ambiguity have been developed. Assuming neo-additive capacities and using the Chateauneuf et. al. (2007) model, we explore evolutionary stability of ambiguity-contingent preferences in different types of games. Could optimistic agents have an persistent and stable advantage in certain settings? Joint work with [Thomas Seiler](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?personid=34461033).

### Games with *unknown unknowns*
Inspired by Grant and Quiggin (2013) as well as Karni and Vierø (2014), I study the effect of knowledge of one's own unawareness of possible states of the world in strategic environments. I aim to create a simple one-shot model of such decisions and test how important reasoning about one's unawareness is in the lab.
