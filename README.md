# CV of Adam Altmejd
This repository contains my CV. The makefile compiles PDF and HTML variants to be displayed on my website. Since publications are printed using pandoc-citeproc Jekyll on github-pages cannot parse the Markdown file directly.

To compile, make sure you have [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org) and `latex` (through e.g. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) and run `make all`.

All code is distributed under the MIT license. The content of the CV is property of Adam Altmejd. Feel free to fork and redesign the template as you like, just include your own merits :--).
